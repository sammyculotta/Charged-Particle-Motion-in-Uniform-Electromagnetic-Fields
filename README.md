Charged Particle Motion in Uniform Electromagnetic Fields
Overview

This project simulates the motion of a charged particle in uniform electric and magnetic fields using the velocity Verlet integration method. The simulation numerically solves the classical equations of motion derived from the Lorentz force law, allowing one to study trajectories such as linear acceleration, circular motion, and helical motion depending on the applied fields.

The code is written in Python using NumPy and is designed to be modular, readable, and easily extensible to more general field configurations.
